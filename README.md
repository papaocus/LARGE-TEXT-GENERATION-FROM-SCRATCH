# LARGE-TEXT-GENERATION-FROM-SCRATCH


GitHub Description: Text Generation with BERT-based Language Model
This project demonstrates how to generate text using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The code is built using the from_pretrained function from the Hugging Face library, specifically the 'bert-base-uncased' pre-trained model.

The generate_text function takes a prompt as input and generates text by iteratively predicting the next token using the BERT model. The maximum length of the generated text can be specified, and the generation process stops when a sentence-ending token ('.', '?', '!') is predicted or the maximum length is reached.

The code also includes an API endpoint /generate_text that accepts POST requests with JSON data. The API expects a JSON object containing a 'prompt' field, and it responds with a JSON object containing the generated text in the 'generated_text' field.

To run the application, execute the script and access the API at http://localhost:5000/generate_text. The API runs in debug mode and is hosted on port 5000.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to generate text based on your desired prompts using the powerful BERT language model.
